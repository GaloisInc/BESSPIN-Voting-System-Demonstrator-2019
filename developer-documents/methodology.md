# The BVS 2020 Development Methodology

We intend to use the SNFM development methodology (evolved based upon
action items from this week’s Q4 on the SBB development process) to
create each subsystem.  As such, there are several mandatory artifacts
associated with each subsystem’s design, implementation, and
assurance.

Some of those artifacts focus on the specification of each subsystem,
and they are:
 - development plan
 - domain model
 - set of requirements
 - scenarios
 - events
 - static architectural model
 - dynamic model
 - user documentation
 - developer documentation
 - API documentation

Assurance artifacts are discussed in `assurance.md`.
