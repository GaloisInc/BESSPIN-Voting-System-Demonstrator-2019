# Overview

This directory contains information for developers on the BESSPIN Voting System project, including coding standards, platform setup, and version control usage guidelines.

Initially, the project aims to support development on both Linux and MacOS.

# Linux host

For compatibility with the GFE project, we assume the baseline Linux distribution is Debian 10 "Buster", currently in its "RC1" release.

# MacOS host

For MacOS, we assume a baseline of MacOS 10.14.x.

# Content

The `HOWTO` files contain a description of how various tools should be installed and set up for the project, particularly aimed at new joiners coming to the project from scratch. `coding_standard.md` contains details about the coding standard for the project. `revision_control.md` contains a description of the revision control practices for the project.

# Future work

In future, we expect to use these HOWTOs to define a NIX script and eventually a virtual-machine image for the baseline development environment.
