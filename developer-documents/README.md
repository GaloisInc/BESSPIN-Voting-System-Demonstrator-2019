# Overview

This directory contains information for developers on the BESSPIN
Voting System project, including coding standards, platform setup,
version control usage guidelines, and a description of our development
process, methodology and artifacts.

Initially, the project aims to support development on both Linux and
MacOS.

# Linux host

For compatibility with the GFE project, we assume the baseline Linux
distribution is Debian 10 "Buster", currently in its "RC1" release.

# MacOS host

For MacOS, we assume a baseline of MacOS 10.14.x.

# Content

The `HOWTO` files contain a description of how various tools should be
installed and set up for the project, particularly aimed at new
joiners coming to the project from scratch. `coding_standard.md`
contains details about the coding standard for the
project. `revision_control.md` contains a description of the revision
control practices for the project.

# Process, Methodology, and Artifacts

To find out more about our development process, methodology, and
artifacts generated thereof, see `process.md`, `methodology.md`, and
`artifacts.md`.

# Future work

In future, we expect to use these HOWTOs to define a NIX script,
Docker image(s), and perhaps a virtual-machine image for the baseline
development environment.
