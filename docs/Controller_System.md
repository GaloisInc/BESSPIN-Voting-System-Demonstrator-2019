# Controller System

## Executive Summary

A *Controller System*, which coordinates the running of an election in
a single polling place.  The Controller System permits an EO to spoil
ballots that voters deem incorrectly filled out or otherwise damaged.
As a part of that workflow—as well as a part of the E2E-V challenge
discussed later—this system also facilitates the issuance of new
ballot style tokens so that a voter can start over and obtain a new
unmarked paper ballot.
