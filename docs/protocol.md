# The BVS 2020 Protocols

All subsystems communicate with each other via the BVS Protocol.  The
BVS protocol has, as its communication elements, digital (packets) and
physical (tokens) mechanisms.  Principals in the protocol include
computational elements (the computers which run subsystem
implementations) and people who use or manage the BVS system and its
subsystems.

The foundational principals and the high-level protocol realized by
the BVS is described in the original proposal submitted to DARPA.  The
BVS product comes in two variants: (1) a traditional voting system
variant that resembles todayâ€™s certified voting systems, and (2) an
end-to-end verifiable variant that is based upon the ElectionGuard
protocol and SDK.
