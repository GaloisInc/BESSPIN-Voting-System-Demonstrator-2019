# The BVS 2020 Protocols

## Overview

All subsystems communicate with each other via the BVS Protocol.  The
BVS protocol has, as its communication elements, digital (packets) and
physical (tokens) mechanisms.  Principals in the protocol include
computational elements (the computers which run subsystem
implementations) and people who use or manage the BVS system and its
subsystems.

The foundational principals and the high-level protocol realized by
the BVS is described in the original proposal submitted to DARPA.  The
BVS product comes in two variants: (1) a traditional voting system
variant that resembles todayâ€™s certified voting systems, and (2) an
end-to-end verifiable variant that is based upon the ElectionGuard
protocol and SDK.

The BVS 2020 Protocol is precisely specified here in natural language.
We use this specification as a means by which to ensure that all *events*
of the system that are realized by protocol actions are included in the
full set of events specified in the BVS 2020 system.  *Events* in our
system specification language can be thought of as, when viewed from the
outside of a subsystem, atomic interactions with a subsystem that
are either *inbound* or *outbound* (*in* and *out* events, respectively).

Examples of concrete realizations of events include:
 - explicit calls to a function or method invocation
 - implicit callbacks to functions bound via closure, UI event frameworks, etc.
 - packets or messages being sent or received on a network socket
 - HTTP RESTful messages being sent or received on a network interface
 - streams of bytes being sent or received via a file descriptor
 - keyboard or mouse input
 - UI updates

## Our Principals

The *human principals* in the BVS 2020 protocol are as follows:

1. An *Election Commission* made up of one or more *Election
   Commissioners*.
2. A Polling Place *Supervisor* who is responsible for a *Polling
   Place* by virtue of being responsible for the Polling Place
   *Controller*.
3. A Polling Place *Worker* who is in the role of a *Voter
   Authenticator* and thus is responsible for a *Registration System*.
4. A Polling Place Worker who is an *Election Assistant* responsible
   for helping voters who have trouble of any kind in the Polling
   Place.
5. Any other members of the *Public*.

The *network principals* in the BVS 2020 protocol are as follows:

1. A *Polling Place Network* is the sole network used by the BVS in a
   polling place. From a technical and security point of view, this
   network can either be a wired or wireless network.  From a federal
   requirements point of view (potentially, wrt VVSG 2.0), wireless
   communications may not be permitted. Likewise, STAR-Vote's RFP
   mandated only the use of Ethernet for network communications,
   primarily to address transparency-related concerns.
   
2. Several computational principals (enumerated below) must be air
   gapped and thus are not on any network at all. Preferably, these
   systems in a certified deployment would not even have the physical
   capability to communicate with the outside world over a physical or
   wireless network.

The *computational principals* in the BVS 2020 protocol are as
follows.  Each of these is summarized in the `BVS 2020 system
description.md`. *Core* principals are mandatory and are the focus of
red team activities, according to our SOW with Galois and thus DARPA.
*Supplemental* principals are necessary to create the BVS 2020, but
are not subject to SSITH-centric red teaming and will run on COTS
systems.  *IR&D* principals are
