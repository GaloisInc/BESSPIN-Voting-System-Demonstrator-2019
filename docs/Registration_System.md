# Registration System

## Executive Summary

A *Registration System* (also known as an *Electronic Pollbook*, or
*ePollbook* for short) that is used to facilitate the identification of
legal voters in a specific polling place or vote center.  Voters that
are permitted to vote are associated with a *Ballot Style*.  Voters that
are in the wrong polling place are redirected to their proper polling
place.  Voters that are not permitted to vote are turned away.  Each
of these kinds of transactions on voters is logged for the
authorities.  Voters are only permitted to vote once in an election.
