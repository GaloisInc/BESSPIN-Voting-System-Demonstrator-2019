# Ballot Scanning Device

## Executive Summary

A *Ballot Scanning Device* (also known as a *Paper Ballot Scanner*, or
*PBS* for short), which converts a paper ballot into a *Cast Vote
Record*—a digital representation of the paper ballot’s contents (the
voter’s selections).  The PBS can determine based upon such an
interpretation if a ballot is incompletely or improperly marked and
(optionally) provide the voter feedback on such (it can detect
undervotes and overvotes and difficult-to-interpret ballots).

In the case of an E2E-V PBS, the PBS prints an *E2E-V Ballot Receipt*
(aka a *Vote Tracker*, in ElectionGuard lingo).  Only after the
tracker is in the voter’s hands does the PBS permit the voter to cast
or spoil (aka an E2E-V challenge) their ballot.  In the latter case,
the voter returns to the Controller System to obtain a new unmarked
paper ballot.  In the former case, the voter takes their digitally
cast ballot to the *Smart Ballot Box*.
