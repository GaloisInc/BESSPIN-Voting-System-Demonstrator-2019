# Tabulation Device

## Executive Summary

A *Tabulation Device* computes the outcome(s) of an election from the
*Cast Vote Records* component of an electionâ€™s evidence.

## Overview

For a traditional election, tabulation is performed on cleartext
data, preferably in the simplest means possible, and is double-checked
through external tabulation of the same data (say, using a
spreadsheet).

For an E2E-V voting system, tabulation is accomplished
either via a decryption step (in the case of many mixnet-based
systems) or via homomorphic tabulation (as is the case with
ElectionGuard).

In both settings, a tabulator is nothing more than a (usually deterministic)
function that takes a set of CVRs and produces a total of all votes for all
contests.

Election statutes and sometimes rules dictate how one tabulates a set of
ballots, often by explaining how one tabulates votes in a single race.
Thus, a tabulator is a computational algorithmic translation of those
statutes and rules into code or processes.  Tabulation is a process in the 
case that the tabulator is one or more human beings performing a hand-count.

Formally verified tabulators have been created to realize several (often very 
complex voting) methods.  Many of these tabulators were created by Joe Kiniry's 
research group when he was a professor.  These include:
 - [the Netherlands list-based method](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/KOA/tree/master/TallySystems/Dutch), 
 - [Denmark's single-selection method](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/DIVS), and 
 - [Ireland's Proportional-Representation through Single Transferable
   Vote (PR-STV) method](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/Votail).

Free & Fair has created two high-assurance tabulators:
 - [San Francisco's Rank Choice Voting (RCV) method]
   (https://github.com/FreeAndFair/formal-rcv), and 
 - for homomorphic tabulation of plurality method ballots in
   ElectionGuard, as a part of its 
   [verifier](https://github.com/microsoft/ElectionGuard-SDK-Reference-Verifier).

@todo kiniry Where are the docs, specs, and code for this subsystem?

The following issues track the design and development of this
subsystem:

## Glossary

Our system glossary is based upon the 
[Free & Fair Election Glossary](https://github.com/FreeAndFair/ElectionGlossary), 
which is in turn based upon the NIST Election Glossary.

## Requirements

Given that we are implementing a traditional and an E2E-V voting system in 
BVS 2020, we need two tabulators: one that can tabulate plaintext CVRs, and
one that can homomorphically tabulate enciphered CVRs.  The latter is included
with ElectionGuard.
