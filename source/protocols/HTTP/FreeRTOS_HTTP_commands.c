 ***   FREERTOS+TCP IS STILL IN THE LAB (mainly because the FTP and HTTP     ***
 ***   demos have a dependency on FreeRTOS+FAT, which is only in the Labs    ***
 ***   download):                                                            ***

 ***   FreeRTOS+TCP is functional and has been used in commercial products   ***
 ***   for some time.  Be aware however that we are still refining its       ***
 ***   design, the source code does not yet quite conform to the strict      ***
 ***   coding and style standards mandated by Real Time Engineers ltd., and  ***
 ***   the documentation and testing is not necessarily complete.            ***
 ***                                                                         ***
