# Overview

This directory contains a description of the Software Development Environment for the BESSPIN voting system project.

Initially, the project aims to support development on both Linux and MacOS.

# Linux host

For compatibility with the GFE project, the baseline Linux distro assumed is Debian 10 "Buster", currently in its "RC1" release.

# MacOS host

For MacOS, we assume a baseline of MacOS 10.14.x

# Content

The HOWTO files contain a description of how various tools should be installed and set up for the project, particularly aimed at new joiners coming to the project from scratch.

# Future work

In future, we expect to use these HOWTOs to define a NIX script and eventually a virtual-machine image for the baseline development environment.
