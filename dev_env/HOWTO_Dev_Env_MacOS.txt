Starting Point
--------------

1. I Started with clean install of MacOS 10.14.5, running in a VM under Parallels.

BASICS
------

2. Install Homebrew

OPAM
----

3. Install and initalize opam

   brew install opam
   opam init  (respond 'y' and 'y' to two questions)

Frama-C
-------

4. Install Frama-C using opam
5. Check Frama-C realy is version 18.0 (Argon)

CLANG
-----

6. Clang is installed by default on MacOS, in /usr/bin/clang


Clang-Format
------------

7. brew install clang-format

LLVM-Link
---------

Currently, I cannot find a package or binary release of llvm-link for
MacOS. This impacts the "make bytecode" target, which in turn, is needed
for verification using SAW. TBD.


MILESTONE 1
-----------

This set of tools should be enough to reproduce the Frama-C analyses
of the SHAVE application software.
