Starting Point
--------------

1. Completely basic intall of Debian Buster RC1  in a VM under Parallels Desktop Pro 14 on a MacBook pro running MacOS 10.14.5

2. Created a single, standard user account "rchapman". This will be used from now on
for all steps below.

3. Installed Parallels Tools for Linux.

Basics
------

   su to "root"
   apt-get install emacs
   add user "rchapman" to group "sudo" in /etc/group
   Reboot

OPAM
----

4. sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   sudo apt install opam
   sudo apt install mccs

5. opam init --solver=mccs (respond 'y' and 'y' to two questions)

6. Shutdown and restart Linux here to allow environment changes to take effect.

Frama-C
-------

See https://frama-c.com/install-18.0-Argon.html

6. opam install depext
   opam depext frama-c
   opam install frama-c

CLANG
-----

8. sudo apt install clang
   sudo apt install clang-format

      installs in /usr/bin/clang
      --versionb reports 7.0.1-8
      Main files in /usr/lib/llvm-7 including bin/llvm-link


MILESTONE 1
-----------

This set of tools should be enough to reproduce the Frama-C analyses
of the SHAVE application software.



TO DO
=====

This not covered by this HOWTO (yet...)

1. Extra provers for Frama-C: cvc4, z3, yices

2. Compilers for target development (RISC-V tools etc.)

3. SAW
