This is an example of how to overwrite instructions in the SBB code. You can't write directly to the SBB code, but you can write instructions to the `malware` function that will write to the SBB code. This exploit walks through how to overwrite the function responsible for validating barcodes to always return `BARCODE_VALID`.

This is a placeholder, more documentation and code to follow.
