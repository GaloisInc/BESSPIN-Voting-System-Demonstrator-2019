# The Lando specification of the BESSPIN Voting System

The top level of the system specification is found in the Lando
specification file `besspin_voting_system.lando`.  

The specification found in `specification_requirements.md` enumerates
the requirements that apply to our specifications as a part of the
SNFM methodology.  It is a characterization of what constitutes a
rich and complete specification.

Each subsystem is specified in its own subdirectory.  Development
plans are summarized in Lando files with the name
`development_plan.lando` and have a regular format.  Their contents
map directly to our OmniPlan plan, which is not included in this
repository at the moment.
